# Data Description

## Data Source
Our data comes from the [US Department of Education College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/), specifically the ["Most Recent Institution-Level Data" from September 14, 2022](https://ed-public-download.app.cloud.gov/downloads/Most-Recent-Cohorts-Institution_09012022.zip). The raw dataset contains 2,989 features on 6,681 institutions but we've chosen to focus on 1,990 institutions that are:

-   Primarily four-year degree granting institutions (for undergraduates)
-   The main campus only (if an overall insitutition has mulitple campuses)

[This dataset is well documented](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/) and [we have built a small pipeline for ingesting the raw DOE data and creating a dataset for our analysis](https://github.com/ajb5d/CollegeScorecard/blob/main/get_data.R).
