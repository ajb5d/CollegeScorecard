# Executive Summary

The high cost of tuition is one of the biggest concerns for students looking to complete their undergraduate studies in the United States. Tuition and fees have significantly increased over the past decade which resulted in increased student(loan) debts resulting in a total of $1.75 trillion in student loan debt (including federal and private loans) with each borrower owing $28,950, on average. With higher tuition rates and less students in Undergraduate/Graduate programs, we can see a rise in unemployment and student debt, and a decrease in earnings and economic growth.  As higher education can play a large part in overall national economic growth, itâ€™s important to identify the variables that influence high tuition fees and to address them, to encourage current and future generations to plan for affordable and debt-free higher education.
